# Mac Automation
My scripts, workflows and shortcuts to automate my Mac and iOS devices

***Sample code from my article on Medium https://eplt.medium.com/how-i-automate-my-mac-and-ios-workflow-fcc03121870d***

I use a combination of Shortcuts, Automator, Apple Script and Shell scripting. It’s not actually that technical, you just need to play around with these apps.

There is also a gist for various mac commands I use often: https://gist.github.com/eplt/027c99215e37a3a138c32b19a944b05d

A few of you have reached out for help to actually install these for you. Not something that I generally do because you might need to share your screen with me over teamviewer or something, and I just don’t want to risk messing up your computer. Mac Automation is already simple enough and it is just a little bit more challenging than using Word or Excel. But of course, if you really need help, I can setup a gig on fiverr as a last resort. Or just arrange for a coffee chat https://www.buymeacoffee.com/eplt to share ideas about other automation projects.
